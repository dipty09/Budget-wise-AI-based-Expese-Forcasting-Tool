*AI-Based Expense Forecasting Tool*
-------------------------------------

*1. Project Overview*
-----------------------

*1.1 Project Idea*  
The AI-Based Expense Forecasting Tool is designed to track, categorize, and forecast user spending using AI/ML models.  
It enables individuals and businesses to manage budgets, predict overspending, and gain actionable insights.

*Problem Solved:*  
• Overspending without realizing it.  
• Manual budgeting being error-prone and time-consuming.  
• Difficulty in estimating future spending.

*1.2 Purpose*  
The tool helps users to:  
• Manage budgets effectively.  
• Predict overspending.  
• Provide actionable insights for decision-making.

*1.3 Problem Statement*  
The project addresses key challenges:  
• Lack of awareness of spending patterns.  
• Human error in manual tracking.  
• Difficulty in future financial estimation.

*3. AI/ML Modelling and Evaluation*
-------------------------------------

*3.1 Forecasting Models*  

Model | Use Case / Benefit | Complexity  
------|--------------------|------------  
ARIMA / SARIMA | Captures historical trends and seasonality. | Basic  
Prophet (Meta/Facebook) | Handles holidays and seasonality with a simple API. | Intermediate  
RNNs & LSTMs | Captures long-term dependencies in sequential data. | Advanced  

*3.2 Advanced AI Techniques*  
• Anomaly Detection: Detects unusual or large transactions.  
• Scenario Analysis: Simulates “What if” conditions, such as rent increases.

*3.3 Model Evaluation Metrics*  

Metric | Description  
-------|-------------  
MAE (Mean Absolute Error) | Average magnitude of forecast errors.  
RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) | Penalizes large deviations.  
MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) | Forecast accuracy in percentage terms.
