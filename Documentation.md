1.Projection Overview: -
1.1 Project Idea
The project is an AI-Based Expense Forecasting Tool that tracks, categorizes, and forecasts user spending using AI/ML models. It helps individuals and businesses manage budgets, predict overspending, and gain actionable insights.  
The tool solves the problems of overspending, manual budgeting being error-prone, and the difficulty of estimating future spending.
1.2 Purpose
The tool aims to help individuals and businesses:
•	Manage budgets effectively.  
•	Predict overspending.  
•	Provide actionable insights.  
1.3 Problem Solved
The tool addresses common budgeting challenges:  
•	People overspending without realizing it.  
•	Manual budgeting being time- and consuming error-prone.  
•	The difficulty in estimating future spending.
2.Technical Scope and Data Preparation: -
   2.1 Technical Scope: 
         Input: Expense data (CSV/API).  
         Processing: AI/ML models.  
         Output: Forecasts, alerts, and insights.  
    2.2 Data Preparation
        Feature Engineering: Key features extracted include Month, weekday, seasonality, cumulative spending patterns, and category grouping.  
        API Integration: Setup for auto data sync with Google Sheets and real-time data from Bank feeds.
3.AI/ML Modelling and Evaluation: -
     3.1 Forecasting Models
        The project utilizes a tiered approach for forecasting:
          | Model | Use Case/Benefit | Complexity |
          | :--- | :--- | :--- |
          | *ARIMA/SARIMA* | Uses historical trends; captures seasonality & cycles. Good for simple trends. | Basic |
          | *Prophet Model* (by Facebook) | Handles holidays & seasonality well; simple API, fast results. Good for seasonality. | Intermediate |
          | *RNNs & LSTMs* | Designed for sequential data; captures long-term dependencies. Best for complex, long-term forecasts. | Advanced |
     3.2 Advanced AI Techniques
           Anomaly Detection: Used to identify unusual spending, such       as a sudden large purchase.  
           Scenario Analysis: Allows for simulations like: "What if my rent increases by 10%?".  
     3.3 Model Evaluation Metrics
            Model performance is evaluated using standard metrics:  
                MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
                RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
               MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

4. Application and Deployment
     4.1 Application Features
•	         Dashboard Overview: Visualizes total spend, category   distribution, and the future forecast graph.  
•	        Budget Alerts: Delivers warnings via push notifications or emails (e.g., "⚠ You will overshoot travel by 20%").  
•	       Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly (for interactive visualization).  
    4.2 App Development and Cloud Deployment
•	Development Options: Flask (Python web framework), Streamlit (quick dashboards), and Dash (interactive apps).  
•	Cloud Deployment: Options include Heroku (simple hosting), Render (easy setup), or AWS/GCP (scalable).
5. Version Control and Professional Practice
•	The project uses Git and GitHub for version control, code management, and collaboration.
•	Repository URL:  https://github.com/dipty09/Budget-wise-AI-based-Expese-Forcasting-Tool
•	Purpose: GitHub is used for version control, collaboration, and showcasing code snippets (Python: ARIMA/Prophet examples).  
•	Branches: Development work is managed in feature branches, merged into main after review.
•	Live Demo: The GitHub repository hosts the code backing the Sample Streamlit app screenshot.
6. Security and Ethics
•	Security: Financial data is encrypted, privacy is ensured, and GDPR/Compliance considerations are addressed.  
•	AI Ethics: Emphasis on Fairness & transparency in AI recommendations.
7. Future Enhancements
The following features are planned for future development:  
•	NLP for transaction categorization.
•	Integration with personal finance apps.
•	An AI chat assistant for budgeting.
